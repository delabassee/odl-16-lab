# Lab 8: Sealed Classes

<div style="display: none;"><span><img src="https://billy.delabassee.com:8080/p/odl-16-lab/8"></span></div>

## Overview

In this 10-minutes lab, you will get some hands-on experiences with **Sealed Classes** (JEP 397), a preview feature (2nd round in Java 16). This new feature enables the ability to create restricted class hierarchy. That is a class or interface that can declaratively restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them.


ðŸ’¡ Despite its name, the **Sealed Classes** feature applies to both **classes** and **interfaces**.

## Restricted  Class Hierarchies

In Java, a class hierarchy enables the reuse of code via inheritance: The methods of a superclass can be inherited (and thus reused) by many subclasses. However, the purpose of a class hierarchy is not always to reuse code. Sometimes, its purpose is to model the various possibilities that exist in a domain, such as the kinds of shapes supported by a graphics library or the kinds of loans supported by a financial application. When the class hierarchy is used in this way, restricting the set of subclasses can streamline the modeling.

A Sealed Class (or interface) can be extended (or implemented) only by those classes (and interfaces) explicitly permitted to do so.

* A new **`sealed` modifier** has been introduced to **seal** a class

* A new **`permits` clause** is then used to explicitly **specify** the class(es) that is(are) permitted to extend the sealed class 

Additionally a sealed class imposes three constraints on its permitted subclasses (the classes specified by its `permits` clause):

* The sealed class and its permitted subclasses must belong to the same module, and, if declared in an unnamed module, the same package.

* Every permitted subclass must directly extend the sealed class.

* Every permitted subclass must choose a modifier to describe how it continues the sealing initiated by its superclass:

    * A permitted subclass may be declared final to prevent its part of the class hierarchy from being extended further.
    * A permitted subclass may be declared sealed to allow its part of the hierarchy to be extended further than envisaged by its sealed superclass, but in a restricted fashion.
    * A permitted subclass may be declared non-sealed so that its part of the hierarchy reverts to being open for extension by unknown subclasses. (A sealed class cannot prevent its permitted subclasses from doing this.)
 

## Your first Sealed Classes

ðŸ’¡ **Sealed Classes** is a preview feature in JDK 16 so make sure that preview features are enabled both at compile time and run-time.

For the sake of this exercise, let us suppose that the conference application needs to deal with sessions of different types. 

Broadly speaking, the conference has the following sessions :

* **Breakout** session, each has a virtual room
	* **Lecture**: a traditional conference session
	* **Lab**: a hands-on lab
* **Keynote** session, a traditional general session

All extend the **Session** abstract class

1. Create a `session` directory (`mkdir -p src/main/java/conference/session/`) and create the abstract sealed `Session.java` superclass.

```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/session/Session.java
</copy>
```

```
<copy>
package conference.session;

import conference.Track;

sealed public abstract class Session
permits Keynote, Breakout {

    private String id;
    private String title;

    public Session(String id, String title) {
        this.title = title;
        this.id= id;
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
}
</copy>
```

ðŸ”Ž `sealed public â€¦ class Session` âž¡ declares it to be a **sealed** class.

ðŸ”Ž `permits Keynote, Breakout â€¦` âž¡ explicitly declares that only the `Keynote` and the `Breakout` classes can extend it.


2. Now you need to create both `Keynote.java` and `Breakout.java` classes

```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/session/Keynote.java
</copy>
```


```
<copy>
package conference.session;

final public class Keynote extends Session {

    public String getKeynoteSpeaker() {
        return keynoteSpeaker;
    }

    String keynoteSpeaker;

    public Keynote(String id, String keynoteSpeaker, String title) {
        super(id, title);
        this.keynoteSpeaker = keynoteSpeaker;
    }
}
</copy>
```
ðŸ”Ž `Keynote.java` is **final**, it can't be extended.


```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/session/Breakout.java
</copy>
```

```
<copy>
package conference.session;

import java.util.Random;

public sealed abstract class Breakout extends Session
permits Lab, Lecture {

    private String speaker;
    private int virtualRoom;

    public Breakout(String id, String title, String speaker) {
        super(id, title);
        this.speaker = speaker;
        this.virtualRoom = new Random().nextInt(3) + 1; // randomly assign a room
    }

    public String getSpeaker() {
        return speaker;
    }

    public int getVirtualRoom() {
        return virtualRoom;
    }
}
</copy>
```
ðŸ”Ž `Breakout.java` is also **sealed**, it **permits** both the `Lab` and the `Lecture` classes to extend it.

3. Create the `Lecture.java` and `Lab.java` classes

```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/session/Lecture.java
</copy>
```

```
<copy>
package conference.session;

final public class Lecture extends Breakout {

    String slidesUrl;

    public Lecture(String id, String title, String speaker, String slidesUrl) {
        super(id, title, speaker);
        this.slidesUrl = slidesUrl;
    }

    public String getSlidesUrl() {
        return slidesUrl;
    }
}
</copy>
```

```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/session/Lab.java
</copy>
```

```
<copy>
package conference.session;

final public class Lab extends Breakout {

    String labUrl;

    public Lab(String id, String title, String speaker, String labUrl) {
        super(id, title, speaker);
        this.labUrl = labUrl;
    }

    public String getLabUrl() {
        return labUrl;
    }
}
</copy>
```

ðŸ”Ž Both classes are `final`.


4. Create a fictional `AgendaRepository.java` class

```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/AgendaRepository.java
</copy>
```

```
<copy>
package conference;

import conference.session.Keynote;
import conference.session.Lab;
import conference.session.Lecture;
import conference.session.Session;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public final class AgendaRepository {

    private final List<Session> sessionList;

    public AgendaRepository() {
        var keynote = new Keynote("001", "007", "The Future of Java Is Now");
        var s1 = new Lecture("005", "Java Language Futures - Early 2021 Edition", "021", "https://speakerdeck/s1");
        var s2 = new Lecture("006", "ZGC: The Next Generation Low-Latency Garbage Collector", "005", "https://slideshare/s2");
        var s3 = new Lecture("007", "Continuous Monitoring with JDK Flight Recorder (JFR)", "010", "https://speakerdeck/007");
        var hol1 = new Lab("010", "Building Java Cloud Native Applications with Micronaut and OCI", "030", "https://github.com/micronaut");
        var hol2 = new Lab("011", "Using OCI to Build a Java Application", "019", "https://github.com/011");

        sessionList = List.of(keynote, s1, s2, s3, hol1, hol2);
    }


    public List<Session> getAll() {
        List<Session> allSessions = sessionList.stream().toList();
        return allSessions;
    }


    public Optional<Session> getBySessionId(String sessionId) {
        Optional<Session> session = sessionList.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.getId().equals(sessionId))
                .findFirst();
        return session;
    }
}
</copy>
```

5. Create `AgendaService.java`

```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/AgendaService.java
</copy>
```

```
<copy>
package conference;

import conference.session.Session;
import conference.AgencyRepository;
import io.helidon.webserver.Routing;
import io.helidon.webserver.ServerRequest;
import io.helidon.webserver.ServerResponse;
import io.helidon.webserver.Service;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.logging.Logger;


public class AgendaService implements Service {

   private final AgendaRepository sessions;
   private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(AgendaService.class.getName());

   AgendaService() {
      sessions = new AgendaRepository();
   }

   @Override
   public void update(Routing.Rules rules) {
      rules.get("/", this::getAll);
   }

   private void getAll(final ServerRequest request, final ServerResponse response) {
     LOGGER.fine("getSessionsAll");

     List<Session> allSessions = this.sessions.getAll();
     response.send(allSessions);
   }
}
</copy>
```


6. Update the `createRouting` method in `Main.java` to instantiate the AgendaService and register its handler under the "/sessions" path.


```nohighlight
<copy>
nano src/main/java/conference/Main.java
</copy>
```

```
â€¦
AgendaService sessionsService = new AgendaService();

â€¦
return Routing.builder()
      â€¦
      .register("/sessions", sessionsService)
      .build();

```
As you have probably guessed, you have just created an endpoint to exposes sessions details
It can be accessed via `{public_ip}:8080/sessions`.


7. Create a new session type.

The interesting part of the lab is the restricted Session classes hierarchy that you have created at the beginning. You can challenge it by creating, for example, a new session type (ex. `Quickie`) type that extends `Breakout`. Given that only `Lab` and `Lecture` are permitted to extend `Breakout`, the Java compiler will simply refuse that `Quickie` tries to extends `Breakout` but you should be able to fix this.

## Wrap-up

In this exercise, you have used **Sealed Classes**. Sealed Classes is a new feature that enables a developer to define a restricted classes hierarchy, i.e. a developer has now the ability to explicitly states for a given class (or an interface) which classes (or interfaces) may extend (or implement) it. Sealed Classes is a previewed (2nd round) feature in JDK 16.

For more details, please check [JEP 397: Sealed Classes (2nd Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/397) and the following [Java Feature Spotlight: Sealed Classes](https://www.infoq.com/articles/java-sealed-classes/) article.
